                <div class="text1"><a href="#">Fossil Fuel</a></div>
                <br>Fossil fuel emissions from power plants which burn coal as fuel contributed heavily, along with vehicles burning fossil fuels, to the production of smog. Smog is the result of fossil fuel combustion combined with sunlight and heat.
                The result is a toxic gas which now surrounds our once pristine planet. This is known as “ozone smog” and means we have more problems down here than we do in the sky.

            <div class="grid_4">
                <div class="text1"><a href="#">Carbon Dioixide Emissions</a></div>
                <br>Carbon dioxide is another product from all of the vehicles on the planet as well as unreformed power plants and other industrial facilities. A continually growing population of humans and clear cutting of forests has exacerbated this
                problem so natural defenses are no longer present and carbon dioxide levels are on the rise.
                <br>
            </div>
            <div class="grid_4">
                <div class="text1"><a href="#">Industrial Wastes</a></div>
                <br>Water pollution is a major issue. Many industries dump wastes into rivers, lakes, ponds, and streams in an attempt to hide wastes from EPA inspectors. These water sources feed major crops and food becomes contaminated with a variety
                of chemicals and bacteria, causing rampant health problems.

            <div class="grid_4">
                <div class="text1"><a href="#">Radiations</a></div>
                <br>Radiation comes into play as well. This is an exceedingly nasty pollution issue and requires extensive description. Primarily, there is radiation from the sun. As the natural ozone layer around the Earth has become depleted. The sun
                is wonderful, but the only reason we are able to survive on this planet so close to the sun is due to the fact of natural shielding against solar radiation. As the protective ozone layer around the planet has become thinner, ultraviolet
                radiation has risen significantly, causing increases in skin cancers and other types of cancer in all countries, killing millions of people every year.

            <div class="grid_4">
                <div class="text1"><a href="#">Trading Activities</a></div>
                <br>Trading activities include the production and exchange of goods and services. As regards goods, pollution can be caused by packaging (which often involves the use of plastic, which is made from fossil fuels) or transport, mainly.
                <br>

            <div class="grid_4">
                <div class="text1"><a href="#">Residential Area Pollution</a></div>
                <br>Finally, residential areas provide their fair share of pollution as well. First, to be able to build homes, the natural environment has to be destroyed in one way or another. Wildlife and plants are driven away and replaced by human
                constructions. As it requires the work of industries, construction itself is also a source of contamination of the environment.
